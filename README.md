    1. Install Rust locally/ deploy Rust on a cloud env
    2. run "cargo run" in the working directory
    3. There will be a standard terminal input prompt, prompting the user to input a specific year

The output will display the closeness centrality of a fully connection spatial-temporal graph. The higher the closeness centrality, the higher the prominence of a hotspot.
